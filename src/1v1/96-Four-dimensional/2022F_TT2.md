## Question 1

Completion of this question demonstrates competency in user I/O and competency + mastery in variables

Your job is to write a simple booking app that asks the user to input a day of the week, a starting time, and duration. If the room is free during that time, it will be booked, if the room is not free for some or all of that time, the system will tell the user that the room could not be booked. You may assume that all times begin on a specific hour, and that all bookings are in hour-long increments.

In order to store the bookings, you should create a list of lists of booleans. That is to say, a list of seven elements where each element is a list of 24 boolean (True or False) values representing the booking status for a specific day/hour.





## Question 2

Completion of this question demonstrates competency selection, loops and files, and mastery in selection

Your job is to create a game of MAD-LIBS. Open a file called input.txt and copy the file to output.txt.But you must observe the following rules:

- You should replace all instances of bad words (the only bad words are DARN, HECK, DANG and GOSH[^1]) with the word **CENSORED**





[^1]:if you know of any others, feel free to add them... but I cant imagine a good university student like you knows any worse words
