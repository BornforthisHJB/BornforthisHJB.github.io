## Section A

Suppose we have a directed graph G = (V,E) with n = |V| nodes and m = |E| edges. We wish to use a breadth-first-search algorithm to determine all nodes v ∈ V which are reachable from a source node s ∈ V .

(i) (2 marks) Use big O notation to describe the worst-case time-complexity of the breadth first search algorithm as a function of n and m.

(ii) (2 marks) Briefly describe an example of a problem which can be solved by adapting the breadth-first-search algorithm.
