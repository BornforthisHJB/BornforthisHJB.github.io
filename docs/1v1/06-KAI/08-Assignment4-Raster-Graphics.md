**Instructions**

Did you ever want to see yourself at the top of Mount Everest, walking on a rainbow, or hanging out with world leaders at a global summit? In this assignment, you can . . .

>   你是否曾想看到自己登上珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰，在彩虹上漫步，或在全球峰会上与世界各国领导人一起闲逛?在这个作业中，你可以……



#### Your Image

Using Photoshop, create a multilayered image that features you placed in an unlikely, unique, or impossible location. The final image should be 600 × 800 pixels (horizontal or vertical orientation). Your project should consist of at least five different layers.

-   A picture of yourself, decontextualized from the original image
-   A background image layer (different from the original image) that provides context for your location
-   A text layer with your name, a caption, or a title
-   Two additional image layers that enhance the overall impression of your imaginary scene

Try to make the image as realistic as possible, even as you create a fictional scene. You might place yourself in the Arctic, climbing a national monument, walking on the moon, or standing beside a celebrity. Pay attention to things like the edges of objects, shadows, and color as well as to the proportions of your objects. Use a variety of tools to enhance your image—there are many available in Photoshop and you are encouraged to explore them.

#### Saving Your Work

Save your original project file, layers intact, in Photoshop (PSD) format. Then, when your work is complete, export the image as a JPEG or PNG file for the Web. Pay attention to the file size of your exported images, that they are suitable for the web. The JPEG or PNG file should be less than 2 MB.

You should keep your PSD file after you've exported the images as well. Do not delete it as the Photoshop document will be part of your assignment submission.

#### Publishing Your Image

Create a new directory on your i6 account called "image". Within this directory, create a basic web page called "index.html" for your project and give the page a title.

Use the `![img]()` element to display your JPEG or PNG on the page. The `![img]()` element should include `src`, `width`, `height`, and `alt`attributes that correspond to the image. Add a short paragraph of text that describes the concept for your image.

Add CSS to give your page some basic styles. At minimum, this should include rule sets for the `![img]()` element, paragraph text, and background of the page.

Publish the web page, along with your image (the JPEG or PNG, not the Photoshop document), to the i6 server. Your project should be available at: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/image/. Update the code of your assignments directory to link to this new page.

#### Submitting Your Assignment

Submit the following via Bright Space. 

-   The URL to your new web page that displays the image on i6
-   A compressed archive containing your Photoshop project file, JPG or PNG, HTML and CSS
    *The upload may take time; wait for confirmation before closing the browser window*

Please note that you are required to submit files along with the URL in order to receive credit for your work.

#### Grading

This assignment is worth 10 points.

-   A Photoshop project with at least 5 different layers: 4 image layers and 1 text layer (5 points—1 per layer)
-   A recognizable image of the student, skillfully decontextualized and proportionally placed in a new location (1 point)
-   The image should be 600 × 800 pixels (horizontal or vertical orientation) and the JPEG or PNG file should be under 2 MB in size (1 point)
-   A basic HTML web page that displays the JPG or PNG file on i6 along with a paragraph of text. (1 point)
-   Basic CSS for the image, text, and background of the page. (1 point)
-   The web page's `![img]()` element should include `src`, `width`, `height`, and `alt` attributes that accurately correspond to the image. (1 point)
