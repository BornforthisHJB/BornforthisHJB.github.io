To avoid any confusion regarding this, we will briefly state what is and isn’t allowed when working on an assignment.</p><p>Any document and program code that you submit must be fully written by yourself. You can, of course, discuss your work with fellow students, as long as these discussions are restricted to general solution techniques. Put differently, these discussions should not be about concrete code you are writing, nor about specific results you wish to submit. When discussing an assignment with others, this should never lead to you possessing the complete or partial solution of others, regardless of whether the solution is in paper or digital form, and independent of who made the solution. That means, you are also not allowed to possess solutions by someone from a different year or course, by someone from another university, or code from the Internet, etc. This also implies that there is never a valid reason to share your code with fellow students, and that there is no valid reason to publish your code online in any form.</p>',18),p={href:"https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=e("p",null,"欢迎关注我公众号：AI悦创，有更多更好玩的等你发现！",-1),f=e("details",{class:"custom-container details"},[e("summary",null,"公众号：AI悦创【二维码】"),e("p",null,[e("img",{src:n,alt:"",loading:"lazy"})])],-1),g={class:"custom-container info"},_=e("p",{class:"custom-container-title"},"AI悦创·编程一对一",-1),b=e("p",null,"AI悦创·推出辅导班啦，包括「Python 语言辅导班、C++ 辅导班、java 辅导班、算法/数据结构辅导班、少儿编程、pygame 游戏开发」，全部都是一对一教学：一对一辅导 + 一对一答疑 + 布置作业 + 项目实践等。当然，还有线下线上摄影课程、Photoshop、Premiere 一对一教学、QQ、微信在线，随时响应！微信：Jiabcdefh",-1),y=e("p",null,"C++ 信息奥赛题解，长期更新！长期招收一对一中小学信息奥赛集训，莆田、厦门地区有机会线下上门，其他地区线上。微信：Jiabcdefh",-1),w={href:"http://wpa.qq.com/msgrd?v=3&uin=1432803776&site=qq&menu=yes",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k=e("p",null,"方法二：微信：Jiabcdefh",-1),q=e("p",null,[e("img",{src:a,alt:"",loading:"lazy"})],-1);function v(I,x){const t=d("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),c("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[o("Every student is responsible for the work they submit.
