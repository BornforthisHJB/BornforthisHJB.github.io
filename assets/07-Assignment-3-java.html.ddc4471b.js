To avoid any confusion regarding this, we will briefly state what is and isn\u2019t allowed when working on an assignment.</p><p>Any document and program code that you submit must be fully written by yourself. You can, of course, discuss your work with fellow students, as long as these discussions are restricted to general solution techniques. Put differently, these discussions should not be about concrete code you are writing, nor about specific results you wish to submit. When discussing an assignment with others, this should never lead to you possessing the complete or partial solution of others, regardless of whether the solution is in paper or digital form, and independent of who made the solution. That means, you are also not allowed to possess solutions by someone from a different year or course, by someone from another university, or code from the Internet, etc. This also implies that there is never a valid reason to share your code with fellow students, and that there is no valid reason to publish your code online in any form.</p>',13),m={href:"https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p=e("p",null,"\u6B22\u8FCE\u5173\u6CE8\u6211\u516C\u4F17\u53F7\uFF1AAI\u60A6\u521B\uFF0C\u6709\u66F4\u591A\u66F4\u597D\u73A9\u7684\u7B49\u4F60\u53D1\u73B0\uFF01",-1),g=e("details",{class:"custom-container details"},[e("summary",null,"\u516C\u4F17\u53F7\uFF1AAI\u60A6\u521B\u3010\u4E8C\u7EF4\u7801\u3011"),e("p",null,[e("img",{src:n,alt:"",loading:"lazy"})])],-1),f={class:"custom-container info"},_=e("p",{class:"custom-container-title"},"AI\u60A6\u521B\xB7\u7F16\u7A0B\u4E00\u5BF9\u4E00",-1),y=e("p",null,"AI\u60A6\u521B\xB7\u63A8\u51FA\u8F85\u5BFC\u73ED\u5566\uFF0C\u5305\u62EC\u300CPython \u8BED\u8A00\u8F85\u5BFC\u73ED\u3001C++ \u8F85\u5BFC\u73ED\u3001java \u8F85\u5BFC\u73ED\u3001\u7B97\u6CD5/\u6570\u636E\u7ED3\u6784\u8F85\u5BFC\u73ED\u3001\u5C11\u513F\u7F16\u7A0B\u3001pygame \u6E38\u620F\u5F00\u53D1\u300D\uFF0C\u5168\u90E8\u90FD\u662F\u4E00\u5BF9\u4E00\u6559\u5B66\uFF1A\u4E00\u5BF9\u4E00\u8F85\u5BFC + \u4E00\u5BF9\u4E00\u7B54\u7591 + \u5E03\u7F6E\u4F5C\u4E1A + \u9879\u76EE\u5B9E\u8DF5\u7B49\u3002\u5F53\u7136\uFF0C\u8FD8\u6709\u7EBF\u4E0B\u7EBF\u4E0A\u6444\u5F71\u8BFE\u7A0B\u3001Photoshop\u3001Premiere \u4E00\u5BF9\u4E00\u6559\u5B66\u3001QQ\u3001\u5FAE\u4FE1\u5728\u7EBF\uFF0C\u968F\u65F6\u54CD\u5E94\uFF01\u5FAE\u4FE1\uFF1AJiabcdefh",-1),b=e("p",null,"C++ \u4FE1\u606F\u5965\u8D5B\u9898\u89E3\uFF0C\u957F\u671F\u66F4\u65B0\uFF01\u957F\u671F\u62DB\u6536\u4E00\u5BF9\u4E00\u4E2D\u5C0F\u5B66\u4FE1\u606F\u5965\u8D5B\u96C6\u8BAD\uFF0C\u8386\u7530\u3001\u53A6\u95E8\u5730\u533A\u6709\u673A\u4F1A\u7EBF\u4E0B\u4E0A\u95E8\uFF0C\u5176\u4ED6\u5730\u533A\u7EBF\u4E0A\u3002\u5FAE\u4FE1\uFF1AJiabcdefh",-1),w={href:"http://wpa.qq.com/msgrd?v=3&uin=1432803776&site=qq&menu=yes",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v=e("p",null,"\u65B9\u6CD5\u4E8C\uFF1A\u5FAE\u4FE1\uFF1AJiabcdefh",-1),k=e("p",null,[e("img",{src:r,alt:"",loading:"lazy"})],-1);function q(A,I){const o=l("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),d("div",null,[u,e("p",null,[t("Every student is responsible for the work they submit.
