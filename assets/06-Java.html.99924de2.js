To avoid any confusion regarding this, we will briefly state what is and isn\u2019t allowed</p><p>when working on an assignment.</p><p>Any document and program code that you submit must be fully written by yourself. You can, of</p><p>course, discuss your work with fellow students, as long as these discussions are restricted to</p><p>general solution techniques. Put differently, these discussions should not be about concrete code</p><p>you are writing, nor about specific results you wish to submit. When discussing an assignment</p><p>with others, this should never lead to you possessing the complete or partial solution of others,</p><p>regardless of whether the solution is in paper or digital form, and independent of who made the</p><p>solution. That means, you are also not allowed to possess solutions by someone from a different</p><p>year or course, by someone from another university, or code from the Internet, etc. This also</p><p>implies that there is never a valid reason to share your code with fellow students, and that there is</p><p>no valid reason to publish your code online in any form.</p><p>Every student is responsible for the work they submit. If there is any doubt during the grading</p><p>about whether a student created the assignment themselves (e.g. if the solution matches that of</p><p>others), we reserve the option to let the student explain why this is the case.
