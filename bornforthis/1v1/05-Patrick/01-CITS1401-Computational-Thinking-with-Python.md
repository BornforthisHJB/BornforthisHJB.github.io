# Project 1 Semester 2 2022

## Project 1: 

## Submission deadlines: 

**5:00 pm, Friday 16th September, 2022**

Value: **15%** of CITS1401.

*To be completed individually.*

You should construct a Python 3 program containing your solution to the following problem and submit 

your program electronically on Moodle. The name of the file containing your code should be your student 

ID e.g. 12345678.py. No other method of submission is allowed. Your program will be automatically run on 

Moodle for sample test cases provided in the project sheet if you click the “check” link. However, your 

submission will be tested thoroughly for grading purposes after the due date. Remember you need to

submit the program as a single file and copy-paste the same program in the provided text box. You have 

only one attempt to submit so don’t submit if you are not satisfied with your attempt. All open submissions 

at the time of the deadline will be automatically submitted. There is no way in the system to open the 

closed submission and reverse your submission.

You are expected to have read and understood the University's guidelines on academic conduct. In 

accordance with this policy, you may discuss with other students the general principles required to

understand this project, but the work you submit must be the result of your own effort. Plagiarism

detection, and other systems for detecting potential malpractice, will therefore be used. Besides, if what 

you submit is not your own work then you will have learnt little and will therefore, likely, fail the finalexam.

You must submit your project before the deadline listed above. Following UWA policy, a late penalty of 5% 

will be deducted for each day (or part day), after the deadline, that the assignment is submitted. No 

submissions will be allowed after 7 days following the deadline except approved special consideration 

cases.
