## Instructions

In this assignment, you will create a three-page website about yourself. The focus at this stage of the development process is on describing web page content with HTML.

> 在这项作业中，你将创建一个三页的关于你自己的网站。开发过程的这个阶段的重点是用 HTML 描述网页内容。

## Project Setup

Create a new directory (folder) on your computer called “Assignment2”. Place HTML and image files associated with your new website inside of this directory. The home page of your new website should be named “index.html”. Other pages can be named as you like, but should reflect the content of the page. Remember that all file and directory names should be limited to letters, numbers, and dashes and be lowercase, with no spaces.

> 在您的计算机上创建一个名为“Assignment2”的新目录(文件夹)。将与您的新网站相关的 HTML 和图像文件放在这个目录中。新网站的首页应该命名为“index.html”。其他页面可以根据您的喜好命名，但应该反映页面的内容。请记住，所有文件和目录名都应该限制为字母、数字和破折号，并且要小写，不能有空格。

When your website is finished, you will upload the “Assignment2” directory, along with its contents, to your i6 account. Your new website will then be available at: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/Assignment2/

## Your Website

Three HTML web pages—about you—form the heart of the current assignment. Any combination of your background, interests, or experiences will do as long as it is autobiographical. You are to write these pages using a plain text editor such as [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). The focus of this assignment is on describing web page content with HTML; refrain from styling the pages until the next assignment, CSS.

Here is a list of required elements you should include in these pages.

- There should be semantic text elements on each page, including but not limited to paragraph (

    ) and heading (, , etc.) text.

- The pages should link to each other with “relative” URLs.

- Each page should also include at least one “absolute” URL linking to an external website.

- You should include at least one image (JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG) on each page. (We’ve not covered image editing yet but feel free to use images from your camera or smartphone as well as images downloaded from the web.)

- You should include an HTML list somewhere on one of your pages; this can be an ordered, unordered, or description list.

- There should be semantic section elements on each page, including but not limited to ``, ``, and.

Pay close attention to your HTML tags and be sure to test your pages locally in an up-to-date web browser as you code them. You can also check your HTML code using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Publishing Your Site

Upload your “me” directory, including the HTML and the image files, to the i6 Unix server with an SFTP client such as [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), [Fetch](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software.html), [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/), or [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/). Your files should go in the same “public_html” directory that your assignments page is in, but within the subdirectory called “Assignment2”. Test your pages again in the browser once they are live on the web server to make sure they are accessible. Your new website should be available at: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/Assignment2/

Finally, create a link from the “HTML” line of your assignments directory to the home page of your new website.

## Submitting Your Assignment

Submit the following via [Brightspace](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/). 

- The URL to your pages in the general form of i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/
- A compressed archive containing all the files of your new website

Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.
